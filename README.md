# Roamer (API): Where we enjoy our adventures with our pets alongside us!

This application allows the user to store places they've journeyed along with their pet(s). They are able to keep notes of these specific places by entering the name of the place or area, the location of it and a summary of their experience along with a rating (1-5).

I came up with this idea as I am dog parent myself and wanted an app where I could be able to store data of all the places I have adventured with my dogs. From dog-friendly restaurants to hiking trails, I will be able store as much data as I need and can double-check my previous experience should I decide to re-visit one of these specific places.

## Planning Story

I initially planned to make this app into a safe space where pet owners can communicate amongst each other in a simplified-fashion to get an idea on certain places or areas that others have experienced and to share helpful information before making the trip with their pet(s).
